# Data Structures in C/C++

1. **Project Overview**
   - **Description**: This repository showcases various data structures implemented in C and C++.
   - **Purpose**: To provide examples and implementations of fundamental data structures for educational purposes.

2. **List of Implemented Data Structures**
   - **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.
   - **Graph**: Structures consisting of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, used to represent networks.
   - **Leftist Heap**: A priority queue implemented with a leftist tree, optimized for merge operations.
   - **Priority Queue**: An abstract data type where each element has a "priority" associated with it, and elements are served based on their priority.
   - **Binary Tree**: A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right child.
   - **Circular Linked List**: A linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.
   - **Linear Linked List**: A sequence of elements where each element points to the next, and the last element points to null.
   - **Queue**: A collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by adding entities at one end and the removal from the other (FIFO principle).
   - **Splay Tree**: A self-adjusting binary search tree with the additional property that recently accessed elements are quick to access again.
   - **Stack**: A linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out).
